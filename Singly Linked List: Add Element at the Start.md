# 📝 Singly Linked List: Add Element at the Start

This Python program demonstrates the implementation of a **Singly Linked List** where a new element can be added at the **start** of the list.

---

## 🎯 Aim

To write a Python program that adds a **new element** at the **start** of a singly linked list. The program implements a `push_front` method that inserts an element at the front of the list, followed by a method to print the list.

## 🧠 Algorithm

1. **Step 1:** Define a class `Node` with:
   - `data` to store the node's value.
   - `next` to store the reference to the next node.
   
2. **Step 2:** Define a class `LinkedList` with:
   - `head` to point to the first node.
   
3. **Step 3:** In the `LinkedList` class, define a method `push_front(newElement)`:
   - Create a new node with `newElement`.
   - Set the new node's next pointer to the current head node.
   - Set the head to the new node.

4. **Step 4:** Define a method `PrintList()` to display the list:
   - Print the elements of the list or display "The list is empty." if the list is empty.

5. **Step 5:** Instantiate a `LinkedList` object, `MyList`, and add elements at the start using the `push_front()` method.

6. **Step 6:** Call the `PrintList()` method to display the list.
